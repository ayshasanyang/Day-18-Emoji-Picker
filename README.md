# Day 18 - Emoji Picker with Live Search

## 🚀 Project Overview
Welcome to **Day 18** of my **30-Day Coding Challenge**!  
In this project, I built a **searchable emoji picker** that allows users to **quickly find emojis** by typing keywords. The list **filters live** as you type, making it easy to find the perfect emoji for any mood or message.
